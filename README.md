## Project Focus

In this project, my primary focus was on leveraging the following technologies:

- **ThreeJS**: A robust 3D graphics library for rendering and animating 3D models.
- **React Three Fiber**: A widely used library that facilitates the creation of 3D graphics with ThreeJS within React applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A popular utility-first CSS styling framework.
- **Framer Motion**: The leading library for animating React websites, bringing them to life with dynamic animations.

## Key Objectives

I aimed to achieve the following objectives throughout the development process:

- **3D Graphics Handling**: Loaded, created, and customized captivating 3D models and geometries, experimenting with various lighting techniques. Gained insights into the 3D world, understanding camera functionality and object positioning in space.

- **Code Reusability and Scalability**: Implemented best practices, including the use of Higher Order Components (HOCs), to make the codebase more reusable and scalable.

- **Form Functionality**: Integrated a form on the website to enable users to send emails seamlessly.

- **Responsive Design and Performance Optimization**: Ensured responsiveness across all devices and improved site performance using techniques such as Suspense and Preload.

Feel free to explore the project and discover the immersive 3D experiences it offers!
